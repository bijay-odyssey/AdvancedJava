# Advanced Java

This repository contains the code I developed while learning **Advanced Java** in preparation for my upcoming exams. The goal of this project is to master core concepts and practical applications of Java, with a focus on building desktop applications and working with databases.

## Key Topics Covered:
### üñ•Ô∏è **Swing (GUI Development)**  
- Creating **Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs)** for desktop applications using **Java Swing**.  
- Building interactive forms and handling user inputs in real-time.

### üóÉÔ∏è **JDBC (Java Database Connectivity)**  
- Establishing a connection between Java applications and relational databases using **JDBC**.  
- Executing SQL queries to interact with a database directly from Java code.

### üîÑ **CRUD Operations**  
- Implementing **Create**, **Read**, **Update**, and **Delete** operations to interact with a database.  
- Managing user data through database interaction using SQL queries.

### ‚ö° **Statement vs. PreparedStatement**  
- Understanding the differences between `Statement` and `PreparedStatement` for executing SQL queries.  
- Focusing on performance improvements and **security**‚Äîespecially the prevention of **SQL injection** attacks.

### üîÑ **Handling Multiple Queries**  
- Implementing methods to handle multiple SQL queries in a single database transaction.  
- Ensuring that queries are executed efficiently and consistently.

## Features:
- **GUI-based user interaction** built with **Swing**, allowing for intuitive, interactive desktop applications.
- **Secure database interactions** using **PreparedStatement** to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities.
- **Efficient handling** of multiple SQL queries and database transactions in a single connection.
- Robust **error handling** and **exception management** throughout the application to ensure reliability and smooth user experience.

## Technologies Used:
- **Java SE (Standard Edition)** for core Java programming.
- **JDBC (Java Database Connectivity)** for interacting with relational databases.
- **Swing** for creating **Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs)**.

## How to Run:
1. Clone this repository:  
   `git clone https://github.com/bijay-odyssey/AdvancedJava.git`
   
2. Compile and run the program using your preferred IDE or command-line tools. Ensure you have a compatible JDK version installed.
   
3. Set up a database connection (JDBC URL, username, and password) to test the database interaction features.

## Challenges & Solutions:
- One of the key challenges was optimizing **database performance** when handling multiple queries. By using **PreparedStatements** and efficient transaction management, I was able to ensure a faster and more secure interaction with the database.
- I also faced difficulties with **GUI layout management** in Swing. I resolved this by utilizing layout managers like **GridBagLayout** and **FlowLayout** to create a responsive and user-friendly interface.

## Future Enhancements:
- Implementing **connection pooling** to improve the performance of JDBC interactions.
- Adding support for more complex database operations (e.g., **joins**, **stored procedures**).
- Enhancing the GUI with more modern UI components or migrating to a different framework like **JavaFX**.
